# Travel-Insurance-Predictor
The problem being addressed in this project is if we can accurately predict who will buy travel insurance or not. If it is possible to predict what group of people are more inclined to buy travel insurance we can use customer specific advertising. This specific data set contains 10 columns ranging from education level to chronic diseases. The inspiration behind this project is that I work for the Charlotte Airport and every day I see thousands of potential customers for travel insurance. One thing that this data set is missing is the average payout/profit of travel insurance. It would be very interesting to see if a particular group of people are continually benefiting from travel insurance which could hurt profits.
